# Overview

This is my Rust program. I show my ability to use Rust and share it in my program of inputs, outputs and more. You will see

demonstrations of basic material and a working program. I hope this can help further my coding experience in this industry. 

The purpose of this is to help me with learning new languges. I hope I can teach other just starting Rust too.

# Futrue Work

* I want to add more creative fortunes in the future
* I would love to make this program bigger and have more inputs from the user
* Maybe there could be some easter eggs within the code to provide funny moments
