# Overview

This is my C++ program. I show my ability to use C++ and share it in my program of inputs, outputs and more. You will see

demonstrations of basic material and a working program. I hope this can help further my coding experience in this industry. 

The purpose of this is to help me with learning new languges. I hope I can teach other just starting C++ too.
