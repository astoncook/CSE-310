# Python Databases Tutorial&nbsp

Welcome to my Python Databases Tutorial. Advancing in Python can be a fun thing, but having the basics of efficency and data structures will help a programmer tremendously. These are the topics I am going to cover:

* [Stack]()
* [Set]()
* [Trees]()

Each of my modules will contain an introduction and examples of coding problems that include these topics. Each module will contain a practice problem and a solution at the end of the tutorial for each problem.
