# Overview
Learning about currency and how much it equals compaired to other is very important for future trips out of your country or area.
Use this Web App to convert endless currency at you finger tips. This will allow the use to do quick calculations on the go and see how much their currency is worth in other countries. Watch my YouTube demonstraition to see hoe this works.

# Web Pages

In this application I creadted two seprate web pages. This first one you can see the place to enter in the currency and on the sencond page, it will show the final calculation. These two pages work seemlessly with eachother.
